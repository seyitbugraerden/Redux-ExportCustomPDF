## Introduction

This project showcases how to use the `@react-pdf/renderer` package with React to render PDF content. It includes examples of using the `map` function to iterate over PDF pages and the `fetch` function to retrieve specific text content.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the `@react-pdf/renderer` package and React if you haven't already:



export default PDFViewer;
Extracting Text Content
The fetch function is used to extract specific text content from the PDF document.

## Usage

Make sure to review this example to test its usage. This multi-page structure is a great example for learning how to use this package.


## Benefits
<ul>
  <li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The <code>map</code> function allows for efficient rendering of lists, reducing the amount of manual DOM manipulation required.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous Data Handling</strong>: The <code>fetch</code> function enables asynchronous data loading, allowing your application to handle real-time data and API interactions smoothly.</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: These functions help in building scalable React applications by promoting reusable and maintainable code patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>User Experience</strong>: Proper use of <code>map</code> and <code>fetch</code> enhances the user experience by ensuring that data is displayed dynamically and efficiently, with appropriate handling of loading and error states.</li>
</ul>

## Conclusion

Using the map and fetch functions provided by the pdf-renderer package, you can enhance your PDF processing workflows in React by automating and optimizing the extraction and rendering of information. Whether you are dealing with large volumes of documents or require precise data retrieval, these tools offer the flexibility and efficiency needed to achieve your goals.
